BEFORE YOU START
-----------------------------------------

Binwalk supports Python 2.7 - 3.x. Although binwalk is slightly faster in Python 3, 
the Python OpenGL bindings are still experimental for Python 3, so Python 2.7 is 
recommended.

The following installation procedures assume that you are installing binwalk to 
be run using Python 2.7. If you want to use binwalk in Python 3, some package 
names and installation procedures may differ slightly.



INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------

Binwalk's core features will work out of the box without any additional dependencies.
However, to take advantage of binwalk's graphing and extraction capabilities, multiple
supporting utilities/packages need to be installed.

To ease "dependency hell", a shell script named deps.sh is included which attempts to
install all required dependencies for Debian and RedHat based systems. If you are 
running a different system, or prefer to install these dependencies manually, see the
DEPENDENCIES section below.

Installation follows the typical configure/make process:

    $ ./deps.sh         # Install optional dependencies (caution: many MB of downloads)
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install



DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------------

The following dependencies are only required for optional binwalk features, such as
file extraction and graphing capabilities. Unless otherwise specified, these
dependencies are available from most Linux package managers:

    libqt4-opengl 
    python-opengl 
    python-qt4 
    python-qt4-gl 
    python-numpy 
    python-scipy
    pyqtgraph-0.9.8 [http://www.pyqtgraph.org/downloads/pyqtgraph-0.9.8.tar.gz]
    mtd-utils 
    zlib1g-dev 
    liblzma-dev 
    ncompress 
    gzip 
    bzip2 
    tar 
    arj 
    p7zip 
    p7zip-full 
    openjdk-6-jdk
    firmware-mod-kit [https://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit]


UNINSTALL
-----------------------------------------

The following command will remove binwalk from your system. Note that this will *not* 
remove utilities installed via deps.sh:

    $ sudo make uninstall
